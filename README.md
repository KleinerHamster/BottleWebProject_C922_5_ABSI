# **Simulation Modeling. Queueing System using Monte Carlo method**
>Simulation Modeling is the process of creating and analyzing a digital prototype. It performances digital word in the real world.
>
>Queueing System are simplified mathematical models to explain congestion. A queueing system can be described as a system having a service facility at which units of some kind (generically called "customers") arrive for service.
>
>Monte Carlo method is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.
